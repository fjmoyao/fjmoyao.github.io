## Profile
Data Scientist with a Master’s degree in Data Science and Analytics, specializing in advanced AI techniques, including Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). With over three years of experience, I am proficient in designing and implementing machine learning models, ETL processes, and cloud computing solutions across platforms like Google Cloud and Azure. Experienced in developing dashboards for data-driven decision-making using tools like Data Studio, PowerBI, and Databricks. Passionate about leveraging analytics and AI to drive business innovation and decision-making.

## Projects

- **Llama 3 Chatbox + Stress Detection**
  innovative chatbot application that integrates the state-of-the-art Llama 3 language model with a finely-tuned attention model (RoBERTa) for stress detection. Designed to deliver rapid and accurate interactions, this system utilizes cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) technologies to identify signs of stress in user speech, thereby promoting a healthier and more aware communicative experience.

  **Tech stack:** *Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Streamlit, Groq*
  
  **Skills:** *NLP, API integration, Model Deployment, Sentiment Analysis*

- **Stress Detection using Attention Models**
  Development of an application capable of detecting stress in textual data using advanced Attention Models (RoBERTa). By analyzing written text, particularly from social media platforms like Reddit, this tool identifies linguistic indicators of stress, offering crucial insights that can aid in early mental health interventions and potentially prevent more serious conditions.
